1. Team Overview
•	Purpose: The team you're joining handles high-level, real-time clearing and settlement for inter-bank and intra-bank transactions. This involves ensuring that large volumes of monetary transactions are processed accurately and efficiently for both internal and external banking systems.

2. Getting Started
•	Access Request: Your first step is to request access to all necessary tools and platforms. This is usually managed through an internal system (like the Access Request Management system) where you apply for permissions.
•	First Day Checklist: There might be a checklist specifically for new joiners to help you get set up with essentials like email, access credentials, and basic tools. This ensures you’re ready to start with all the required resources in place.

3. Key Contacts
•	IT Support: For any technical issues, IT Support is your go-to. There’s also a Virtual Assistance option, possibly a chatbot or helpdesk, for quick resolutions to common issues.

4. Development Tools and Resources
•	These are the main tools you’ll use for development. Here’s a breakdown:
o	Version Control - BitBucket: This tool helps you manage and track changes in code. BitBucket is a platform where all team members can collaborate on code in a structured and trackable way.
o	IntelliJ: This is an integrated development environment (IDE) where you’ll write and debug your code. It’s specifically tailored for Java development but supports various other languages and plugins.
o	Build and Deployments - Maven, JFrog:
	Maven: A tool that manages project dependencies, builds the code, and helps in packaging and deploying applications.
	JFrog: A repository manager where different versions of the application’s dependencies and artifacts (files generated by the build process) are stored and managed.
o	Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) - Jenkins and Ansible:
	Jenkins automates building and testing your code whenever changes are made.
	Ansible is for configuration management and automating tasks related to deploying applications.
o	Code Review Tools - Sonar: This tool checks code quality, looking for potential bugs, vulnerabilities, and code style issues.
o	Log Tools - splunkCASH Admin UI: Used to monitor logs and troubleshoot any issues that occur in the application.

5. Policies and Procedures
•	Development Standards: There might be specific guidelines for how to write and format your code. This could include best practices for naming variables, structuring code, and making it readable and maintainable.
•	Commit Message Guidelines: When you make changes to the code, you’ll need to “commit” these changes with a message explaining what was done. This helps everyone understand the purpose of each change.
•	Pull Request Process: When you’re ready to add your changes to the main codebase, you’ll create a “pull request” (PR). This initiates a review process where other team members check your code and give feedback or approve it for merging.

6. Setting Up Your Development Environment
•	IntelliJ Setup and Clone the Repo: You’ll need to set up IntelliJ on your computer and connect it to the repository (repo) where the project code is stored. Cloning the repo means downloading a copy of the project to your local machine so you can work on it.
•	Maven Setup: Setting up Maven involves configuring it to manage the dependencies and build processes for your project. This will allow you to build, test, and run the application on your machine.
•	BitBucket Setup and SSH Key Configuration:
o	BitBucket Setup: Ensure you have access to BitBucket and that your permissions are set up.
o	SSH Key Configuration: SSH keys are a way to securely access servers or systems without typing a password every time. You’ll need to set this up to connect securely to the code repository.
•	How to Set Up and Run Batch Jobs Locally: A “batch job” is a script or command that runs a series of tasks automatically. You’ll need to know how to configure and run these jobs on your computer for testing purposes.

7. Access Request Types
•	The document also includes a table listing different types of access requests, which might include access to specific tools or environments, such as:
o	Horizon CI Access: For accessing the Continuous Integration environment.
o	Horizon Deploy & Release Access: For deployment and release processes.
o	User Access: General access to certain systems.
o	Splunk, Oracle Prod Access, Unix Server Access: For accessing monitoring tools (Splunk), production databases (Oracle), or servers (Unix).
o	Specialized Access like Autosys (for automated job scheduling), JBOSS (for application server access), Ansible, and Alm: These are additional tools or environments you might need access to, depending on your role.
