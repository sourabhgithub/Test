teps to Configure Kafka to Only Allow Requests from a Specific IP (Input Service)
1. Set Up IP Restrictions on the Kafka Server:
Use iptables on Linux, firewall rules on Windows, or cloud security groups (e.g., AWS Security Groups, Azure NSGs) to restrict access to the Kafka server.
For example, using iptables on Linux:

bash
Copy code
# Allow Kafka traffic from the input service IP
sudo iptables -A INPUT -p tcp -s <input_service_ip> --dport 9092 -j ACCEPT

# Reject or drop all other traffic to Kafka
sudo iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 9092 -j REJECT
Replace <input_service_ip> with the IP address of your input service.

2. Configure Kafka Listeners (if needed):
Ensure Kafka is listening on the appropriate network interface and is properly configured to handle the connections from your input service.
Configure the listeners property in server.properties to bind Kafka to the desired network interfaces. For example:
properties
Copy code
listeners=PLAINTEXT://<kafka_ip>:9092
If you need more fine-grained control, you can configure multiple listeners with different security protocols and bind them to specific IPs.
3. Secure Kafka with SASL/SSL for Additional Authentication:
While IP restriction is effective, using SASL (Simple Authentication and Security Layer) with SSL/TLS adds another layer of security to ensure that even if someone gains network access, they cannot connect without proper authentication.

You can configure SASL/SSL in server.properties:

properties
Copy code
listeners=SASL_SSL://<kafka_ip>:9093
security.inter.broker.protocol=SASL_SSL
sasl.mechanism.inter.broker.protocol=PLAIN
sasl.enabled.mechanisms=PLAIN
4. Ensure Kafka ACLs (Access Control Lists) are Properly Set:
After configuring the network-level IP whitelisting and SASL/SSL, set up Kafka ACLs to control which users (principals) can produce or consume messages from specific topics.
For example, to allow a user input-service-user to write to a topic my-topic:

bash
Copy code
kafka-acls --authorizer-properties zookeeper.connect=localhost:2181 --add --allow-principal User:input-service-user --operation Write --topic my-topic
Summary:
IP Restriction: Use firewall rules or iptables to allow only the input service's IP to communicate with Kafka.
Listener Configuration: Ensure Kafka is configured correctly to handle these connections.
Authentication and Authorization: Use SASL/SSL for authentication and ACLs for topic-level authorization to add more security layers.
By combining these network-level and application-level security measures, you can secure your Kafka infrastructure effectively, ensuring only authenticated and authorized requests from a controlled input service are allowed.
